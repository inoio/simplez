simplez
=======

A simple typeclass library inspired by scalaz meant as a learning tool by reducing the initial complexity of scalaz.

`Scalaz` is of course the standard typeclass library for Scala, but learning it can be daunting task for someone new to functional programming. Simplez is a kind of educational tool, a scalaz without many of the alias functions (flatMap, bind, >>=, point, pure, &mu;, ...) with a preference for scala idioms and less functionality. It is not meant as a replacement, but given it's smaller footprint, we believe that it can help understand how `scalaz` works.
